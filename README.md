          <span>“It’s almost like</span> the Explore Tab that we have on
          Instagram” said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in leaked audio of him
          describing TikTok during an all-hands meeting. But it’s not.

          represents a new form of social entertainment that’s vastly different
          from the lifelogging of Instagram where you can just take a selfie,
          show something pretty, or pan around what you’re up to. TikToks are
          premeditated, storyboarded, and vastly different than the haphazard
          Stories on Insta.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why Zuckerberg’s comments cast a dark shadow over the future of

          family of apps. How can it beat what it doesn’t understand? He
          certainly can’t ignore it. Facebook’s copycat Lasso has been installed
          just 425,000 times since it launched in November, while TikTok has 640
          million installs in the same period outside of China. Oh, and TikTok
          has 1.4 billion total installs beyond China to date.

            >Casey Newton of The Verge</a
          >
          today published two hours of audio and transcripts from two
          internal-only all-hands Q&amp;As held by Zuckerberg at Facebook in
          July. His comments touch on
          <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/no-you-suck/"
            >the company’s plan to fight being broken up</a
          >
          by regulators, especially if Elizabeth Warren becomes President. He
          thinks Facebook would win, but on resorting to suing the government,
          he says “does that still suck for us? Yeah.” Zuckerberg also describes
          how Facebook is working to launch a payments product in Mexico and
          elsewhere by year’s end as Libra deals with regulatory scrutiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          But beyond his comments on regulation, it’s his pigeonholing of TikTok
          that’s most alarming. It foreshadows Facebook failing to win one of
          the core social feeds that its business depends on. Perhaps his
          perspective on the competitor is evolving, but the leak portrays him
          as thinking TikTok is just the next Snapchat Stories to destroy.
        </p>
        <h2>Zuckeberg’s Thoughts On TikTok</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s what Zuckerberg said about TikTok during the internal Q&amp;A
          sessions, (emphasis mine):
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p id="4EujHh">
            So yeah. I mean, TikTok is doing well. One of the things that’s
            especially notable about TikTok is, for a while, the internet
            landscape was kind of a bunch of internet companies that were
            primarily American companies. And then there was this parallel
            universe of Chinese companies that pretty much only were offering
            their services in China. And we had Tencent who was trying to spread
            some of their services into Southeast Asia. Alibaba has spread a
            bunch of their payment services to Southeast Asia. Broadly, in terms
            of global expansion, that had been pretty limited, and TikTok, which
            is built by this company Beijing
            <a
              href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance"
              target="_blank"
              data-type="organization"
              data-entity="bytedance"
              >ByteDance, <span></span
            ></a>
            is really the first consumer internet product built by one of the
            Chinese tech giants that is doing quite well around the
            world.<strong>
              It’s starting to do well in the US, especially with young folks.
              It’s growing really quickly in India. I think it’s past Instagram
              now in India in terms of scale.</strong
            >
            So yeah, it’s a very interesting phenomenon.
          </p>
          <p id="RMmgJP">
            And the way that we kind of think about it is:<strong>
              it’s married short-form, immersive video with browse. So it’s
              almost like the Explore Tab that we have on
              <a
                href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram"
                target="_blank"
                data-type="organization"
                data-entity="instagram"
                >Instagram, <span></span
              ></a>
              which is today primarily about feed posts and highlighting
              different feed posts. I kind of think about TikTok as if it were
              Explore for stories, and that were the whole app.</strong
            >
            And then you had creators who were specifically working on making
            that stuff. So we have a number of approaches that we’re going to
            take towards this, and we have a product called Lasso that’s a
            standalone app that we’re working on, trying to get product-market
            fit in countries like Mexico, is I think one of the first initial
            ones. We’re trying to first see if we can get it to work in
            countries where TikTok is not already big before we go and compete
            with TikTok in countries where they are big.
          </p>
          <p id="RotoQ4">
            <strong
              >We’re taking a number of approaches with Instagram, including
              making it so that Explore is more focused on stories</strong
            >, which is increasingly becoming the primary way that people
            consume content on Instagram, as well as a couple of other things
            there. But yeah, I think that it’s not only one of the more
            interesting new phenomena and products that are growing. But in
            terms of the geopolitical implications of what they’re doing, I
            think it is quite interesting. I think we have time to learn and
            understand and get ahead of the trend. It is growing, but they’re
            spending a huge amount of money promoting it. What we’ve found is
            that their retention is actually not that strong after they stop
            advertising. So the space is still fairly nascent, and there’s time
            for us to kind of figure out what we want to do here.
            <strong>But I think this is a real thing. It’s good.</strong>

          To Zuckerberg’s credit, he’s not dismissing the threat. He knows
          TikTok is popular. He knows it’s growing in key international markets
          Facebook and Instagram depend on to keep user counts rising. And he
          knows his company needs to respond via its standalone clone

          But while TikToks might look like Stories because they’re vertical
          videos, and TikTok might algorithmically recommend them to people like
          Instagram Explore, it’s a whole ‘nother beast of a product and one
          that may be harder than it seems to copy.
        </p>
        <p>
          To crystallize why, let’s rewind to Snapchat. With the launch of
          Stories, it started to blow up with US teens. Facebook’s attempts to
          clone it in standalone apps like Poke and Slingshot never gained
          traction. In fact, none of Facebook’s standalone apps have succeeded
          unless they splintered off an already-popular piece of Facebook like
          chat and users were forced to download them like Messenger. It wasn’t
          until Zuckerberg stuck his clone of Stories front-and-center atop
          Instagram and Facebook that
          <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/slowchat/"
            >Snapchat’s user count went from growing 18% per quarter to
            shrinking</a
          >. There, Facebook used the same strategy laid out in Zuckerberg’s
          comments —
          <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/09/the-good-enough-strategy/"
            >push its good-enough clone in countries where the original isn’t
            popular yet</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Facebook was fortunate because Stories really wasn’t that
          dissimilar to the content users were already sharing on Instagram —
          tiny biographical snippets of their lives. Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel
          had originally invented Stories as a vision of Facebook’s News Feed
          through the lens of an ephemeral camera. All users had to know was “I
          take the same videos, but shorter and sillier, posted more often, and
          then they disappear”. The concept of Instagram and Facebook didn’t
          have to change. They were still about telling friends what you were up
          to. Choking off TikTok’s growth will be much more complicated.
        </p>
        <h2>Why TikTok Is Tough To Clone</h2>
        <p>
          TikTok isn’t about you or what you’re doing. It’s about entertaining
          your audience. It’s not spontaneous chronicling of your real life.
          It’s about inventing characters, dressing up as someone else, and
          acting out jokes. It’s not about privacy and friends, but strutting on
          the world stage. And it’s not about originality — the heart of
          Instagram. TikTok is about remixing culture — taking the audio from
          someone else’s clip and reimagining the gag in a new context by
          layering it atop a video you record.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            title="TikTok Remixes"

            sizes="(max-width: 1010px) 100vw, 1010px"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          That makes TikTok distinct enough that it will be very difficult to
          shoehorn into Instagram or Facebook, even if they add the remixing
          functionality. Most videos on those apps aren’t designed to be
          templates for memes like TikToks are. Insta and Facebook’s social
          graphs are rooted in friendship and augmented by the beautiful and
          famous, but don’t encompass the new wave of amateur performers TikTok
          elevates. And since each post to the app becomes fodder for someone
          else’s creativity, a competitor starting from scratch doesn’t offer
          much to remix.
        </p>
        <p>
          That means a TikTok clone would have to be somewhat buried in
          Instagram or Facebook, rebuild a new social graph, and retrain users’
          understanding of these apps’ purpose…at the risk of distracting from
          their core use cases. This leaves Facebook hoping to grow its
          standalone TikTok clone Lasso which
          <a
            href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/facebook-musically-competitor/"
            >TechCrunch scooped a year ago</a
          >
          before it
          <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/lasso-facebook-app-store/"
            >launched last November</a
          >. But as we’ve seen, Facebook struggles growing brand new apps, and
          that effort is further hindered by its increasingly toxic brand and
          sheen of uncoolness. Nor does it help that Facebook must divert
          development resources to comply with all the new privacy and
          transparency obligations as part of its
          <a
            href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees/"
            >$5 billion FTC fine and settlement</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>The Next Feed</h2>
        <p>
          Facebook’s best bet is to assess the future value of the ads it could
          run on a successful TikTok clone and apply some greater fraction of
          that grand sum to competing directly. It’s already made some smart
          additions to Lasso like tutorials for how to remix and the option to
          add GIFs as sections of your video. But it’s still failing to gain
          serious traction in the US. While typical videos on the TikTok
          homepage where I’m spending a few hours a week have hundreds of
          thousands of Likes, the top ones I saw in my Lasso feed today received
          70 or fewer.

            TikTok trounces Facebook’s Lasso in the US iOS App Store charts
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          I had <a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a> run some
          analysis comparing TikTok with Lasso since its launch last November,
          and found that Lasso gets 6 downloads for every 1000 for TikTok in the
          US. Some more stats:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            US Total Downloads Since November: Lasso – 250,000 // TikTok – 41.3
            million
          </li>
          <li>
            US Downloads Per Day Since November: Lasso – 760 // TikTok – 126,000
          </li>
          <li>
            Average US Google Play Social App Chart Ranking: Lasso – #155 //
            TikTok – #2
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Beyond the US, Lasso has only launched in one other market, Mexico in
          April, where it’s been faring better but could hardly even be
          considered a competitor to TikTok. Facebook needs to lean harder into
          Lasso:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mexico Total Downloads Since April: Lasso – 175,000 // TikTok – 3.3
            million
          </li>
          <li>
            Mexico Downloads Per Day Since November: Lasso – 1,000 // TikTok –
            19,000
          </li>
        </ul>

          Zuckerberg may need to find a coherent place for TikTok style features
          inside Instagram and potentially Facebook. That could be another
          horizontal row of previews like with Stories and/or a header on the
          Explore page dedicated to premeditated content. Certainly something
          more prominent than a single button like IGTV that still no one is
          asking for. One opportunity to best TikTok would be building a
          dedicated remix source browser into the Stories camera to help users
          find content to put their own spin on.
        </p>

          Facebook will also need to buy out top TikTok creators to make videos
          for it instead, and even quasi-hire some of the most prolific video
          meme or challenge inventors to give users trends to jump on rather
          than just one-off clips to watch. Its<a
            href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/igtv-landscape/"
          >
            failure to offer IGTV stars monetization</a
          >
          has led many to ignore that platform, and it can’t afford that again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Zuckerberg approaches TikTok as merely an algorithmic video
          recommender like Explore, Facebook will miss out on owning the social
          entertainment feed. If he doesn’t decisively move to challenge TikTok
          soon, its catalog of content to remix will grow insurmountable and it
          will own the whole concept of short form performative video.
          Snapchat’s insistence on ephemerality makes it incompatible with
          remixing, and YouTube isn’t nimble enough to reinvent itself.

          If no American company can step up, we could see our interest data,
          faces, and attention forfeited to an app that while delightful to use,
          heralds Chinese political values at odds with our own. If only Twitter
          hadn’t killed Vine.
